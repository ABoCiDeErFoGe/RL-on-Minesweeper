# RL-on-Minesweeper
The initial intention for this project was to train an agent that can plays the classic game Minesweeper. However, as I was working on the project, I realized that I need a convenient way of training, tweaking hyperparams, measuring performance and possibly visually compare the performance between differnet model. And therefore, this project is about an GUI application that does the above thing, making training agent much easier for everyone!

## Installation and Execution
Before running the application, some dependencies need to be installed:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once completed, the application can be start with:
```
python main.py
```
Enjoy!
